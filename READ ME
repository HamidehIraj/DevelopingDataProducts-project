This Project is about clustering on iris dataset which is a popular data set in R.
The user can determine the number of clusters (k) from 1 to 5 and the backend code on server.R clusters the data using kmeans algoithm and shows a plot of clusters.This is an example of unsupervised learning when you have no labels or predefined groups for your data.

you can simply play with the slidebar to see how it is clustered into k groups determined by the user.

I had different errors and problems publishing this app to www.shinyapps.io so please test it locally on your computer for grading.

Thank you


To run the app:
